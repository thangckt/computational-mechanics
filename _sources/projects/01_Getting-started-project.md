# Computational Mechanics Project #01 - Heat Transfer in Forensic Science

We can use our current skillset for a macabre application. We can predict the time of death based upon the current temperature and change in temperature of a corpse. 

Forensic scientists use Newton's law of cooling to determine the time elapsed since the loss of life, 

$\frac{dT}{dt} = -K(T-T_a)$,

where $T$ is the current temperature, $T_a$ is the ambient temperature, $t$ is the elapsed time in hours, and $K$ is an empirical constant. 

Suppose the temperature of the corpse is 85$^o$F at 11:00 am. Then, 2 hours later the temperature is 74$^{o}$F. 

Assume ambient temperature is a constant 65$^{o}$F.

1. Use Python to calculate $K$ using a finite difference approximation, $\frac{dT}{dt} \approx \frac{T(t+\Delta t)-T(t)}{\Delta t}$.

```

2. Change your work from problem 1 to create a function that accepts the temperature at two times, ambient temperature, and the time elapsed to return $K$.

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
```

3. A first-order thermal system has the following analytical solution, 

    $T(t) =T_a+(T(0)-T_a)e^{-Kt}$

    where $T(0)$ is the temperature of the corpse at t=0 hours i.e. at the time of discovery and $T_a$ is a constant ambient temperature. 

    a. Show that an Euler integration converges to the analytical solution as the time step is decreased. Use the constant $K$ derived above and the initial temperature, T(0) = 85$^o$F. 

    b. What is the final temperature as t$\rightarrow\infty$?
    
    c. At what time was the corpse 98.6$^{o}$F? i.e. what was the time of death?
